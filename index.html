           I recently graduated from The Georgia Institute of Technology 
           with a Bachelor's degree in Computational Media. The focus of my degree was
           Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Design. As a result, I have a lot of experience
           developing AI applications, designing User Interfaces, and Full Stack Software Development. 
           I enjoy implementing various Machine Learning techniques, automating systems, 
           crafting the logic behind AI agents in games, and designing easy-to-use and intutive User Interfaces.
           I also strive to always be learning new things and challenge myself to expand my skills as a programmer.
           <br> In addition to coding and UX/UI design, I also enjoy playing and watching sports, rock-climbing,
           traveling, and gaming. <br> 
           You can check out my  <a href="portfolio.html"> portfolio</a> to see some of the projects I've worked on.
