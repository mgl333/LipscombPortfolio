        <h3>Card Counting Trainer Website</h3>
        <h4>Type: Individually Developed Website Created Using the Flask Micro-Framework, Python, JS, HTML5, and CSS3</h4>
        <h5>Description:</h5>
        <p>This web application teaches users how to count cards in Black Jack. 
            A majority of the training is in the form of games that get progressivly harder as the user levels up 
            and progresses from a complete beginner to expert Card Counter. 
            There will also be video tutorials, diagrams, and charts featured that will assist the user at learning the fundamentals of card counting.
            This project is still in the early stages of development. The finished project should hopefully be available by the end of May 2022!

        <h3>Card Counting Trainer Mobile App</h3>
        <h4>Type: Individually Developed Mobile App Created Using the React Native Framework</h4>
        <h5>Description:</h5>
        <p>This is a mobile app that is being developed simultaneously with the web app listed above. It will have all the same features but made to work best for a mobile app.  
            This project is still in the early stages of development. The finished project should hopefully be available by the end of May 2022!

        <h3>The Perfect Bracket Project Part 1</h3>
        <h4>Type: Individually Developed Console Application coded in Java</h4>
        <h5>Description:</h5>
        <p>
            The goal of this project was to calculate the approximate odds of getting a perfect "March Madness" bracket given that you know what you're doing when filling out your bracket. 
            The theoretical odds of getting a perfect bracket are ~1 in 9.2 Quintillion. This is because there are 9.2 quintillion possible ways to fill out a 64 team bracket. 
            However, since the outcome of each game is not random, an informed individual has significantly better odds of getting a perfect bracket, 
            but previously no one had ever attempted to calculate the odds of an "informed individual" picking a perfect bracket.
            <br>
            To calculate the odds, I looked at every bracket since 1985, and calcuated the percent of games that were upsets for each seeding match-up given the tournament history.
            I then simualted tournaments based on these calculated upset percentages until one was an exact match for a randomly chosen target bracket which was picked from a set of real brackets that happened from 1985-2021.
            After repeating this process thousands of times, I used the average number of simulations it took to get a perfect bracket to calculate the approximate odds.
            I was able to get the odds to as low as ~1 in 100 Billion which is about 100 million times more likely than the theorectical odds. 
            **I will soon be posting a video going more in depth about this project.

        <h3>The Perfect Bracket Project Part 2</h3>
        <h4>Type: Individually Developed Web App Created Using the Spring Boot Framework and Java</h4>
        <h5>Description:</h5>
        <p>This is a web app that is being developed by repurposing parts of the project listed above. This app will allow users to put in their one brackets to be evaluted. 
            The app will recommend changes to the user's bracket to improve their odds of getting a perfect bracket.   
            This project is still in development. The finished project will be available in time for next years tournameny!

        <h3 class="ProjectTitle">Fully Automated YouTube Channels</h3>
        <h4 class="type">Type: Python Scripts</h4>
        <h5 class="description">Description:</h5>
        <p class="des2">
            &emsp; Using AI and automation, I created multiple YouTube channels that scrape different social media platforms for content, then edits the content into one video, and then posts the videos. 
            the goal of this project was to see if it was possible to create a 100% passive stream of income through fully automated YouTube channels.
