        <h3>Card Counting Trainer Website</h3>
        <h4>Type: Individually Developed Website Created Using the Flask Micro-Framework, Python, JS, HTML5, and CSS3</h4>
        <h5>Description:</h5>
        <p>This web application teaches users how to count cards in Black Jack. 
            A majority of the training is in the form of games that get progressivly harder as the user levels up 
            and progresses from a complete beginner to expert Card Counter. 
            There will also be video tutorials, diagrams, and charts featured that will assist the user at learning the fundamentals of card counting.
            This project is still in the early stages of development. The finished project should hopefully be available by the end of May 2022!

        <h3>The Perfect Bracket Project Part 1</h3>
        <h4>Type: Individually Developed Console Application coded in Java</h4>
        <h5>Description:</h5>
        <p>
            The goal of this project was to calculate the approximate odds of getting a perfect "March Madness" bracket given that you know what you're doing when filling out your bracket. 
            The theoretical odds of getting a perfect bracket are ~1 in 9.2 Quintillion. This is because there are 9.2 quintillion possible ways to fill out a 64 team bracket. 
            However, since the outcome of each game is not random, an informed individual has significantly better odds of getting a perfect bracket, 
            but previously no one had ever attempted to calculate the odds of an "informed individual" picking a perfect bracket.
            <br>
            To calculate the odds, I looked at every bracket since 1985, and calcuated the percent of games that were upsets for each seeding match-up given the tournament history.
            I then simualted tournaments based on these calculated upset percentages until one was an exact match for a randomly chosen target bracket which was picked from a set of real brackets that happened from 1985-2021.
            After repeating this process thousands of times, I used the average number of simulations it took to get a perfect bracket to calculate the approximate odds.
            I was able to get the odds to as low as ~1 in 100 Billion which is about 100 million times more likely than the theorectical odds.

        <h5>Description:</h5>
        <p>This is a web app that is being developed by repurposing parts of the project listed above. This app will allow users to put in their one brackets to be evaluted. 
            The app will recommend changes to the user's bracket to improve their odds of getting a perfect bracket.   
            This project is still in development. The finished project will be available in time for next years tournameny!

            the path network was required to allow an AI agennt to traverese the game environment without running into obstacles and reach any point in the environment.
            My solution involved drawing lines that connected each node to every other node, and then I erased all the lines that went through an obstacle.

            Additionally, I implemnted decision making for the AI agents to attack enemies and an enemy base.

            <br>
            &emsp; Most of my agents (green) will take the shortest path unblocked path to the enemy base while 
            attacking any enemies that come into range along the way. Once my agents get in range of the enemy turrets, 
            they will then attack the turrets which need to be destroyed before the base can take damage. 
            If both turrets are destroyed my agent will then attack the base. Additionally, some of my agents 
            will stay along the path and near my base to attack any enemies that attempt to reach my base.

        <p class="des2">
            &emsp;Using the same game engine as in the above projects, 
            I was tasked with implementing Behavior Trees that would dictate how a special type of AI agent 
            operates within the game environment. For this assignment, each team in the game had a "Hero" agent
            that was more ppowerful than the regular agents. The "Hero" agent had multiple types of attacks, 
            could dodge bullets, got more powerful with each enemy it eliminated, and could heal at it's own base.
            Each team had the same AI controlling the normal minion agents, so the difference in the "Hero" agents AI
            would be the only thing that seperates the two teams. 
            <br>
            &emsp; Describing in detail the Behavior Tree I created to control my "Hero" agent would be impossible 
            to do in a single paragraph, but in short, my agent (green with yellow head) prioritized running directly at the enemies "Hero" 
            and then retreating to its own base to heal while still firing at the enemy. My implementation was among 
            the best in the class and was even capable of beating the professor's implementation.

            &emsp;For this project, I, along with a group of other students, created a technology museum in Unity.

            <br>&emsp;To model the TVs, I used Maya and then imported the models into Unity. I then implemented

            &emsp;This was a menu style game that was meant to let the player take the role of President of the 
            United States during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The goal of the player was to mimize the number of deaths
            and infections due to Covid-19. The game incorporated large amounts of real world data to simulate 
            the pandemic as accuratley as possible. The player had the ability to spend government money,
            issue executive orders, and make congressional requests to do several different things that could 
            potentially impact the pandemic. The player also had an approval rating that would change depending on
            how the pandemic was going and the actions they took. The lower the approval rating, the higher the 
            chances were of the population ignoring their orders, or congress ignoring their requests. 
            <br>&emsp;Because the allowed development time for this project was so short, and I already had 
            to spend much of it doing research, I decided to forgo any attempt at making graphical components, 
            and just focused on making the simulation aspect of the game as fleshed out as possible. The game was
            created using a combonation of GameMaker Studio and Java code.

            using AGILE/SCRUM methodologies. As a group, we were assigned a client and we're responsible for the
            full development of the clients product. Our client wanted to build a mobile app that would allow 
            in store shoppers to scan items and pay directly from their phone.
            &emsp;For this project I was involved with writing user stories, carrying out user testing, planning development sprints,
            UI design, and Front-end development. The UI prototypes were created using Figma and the Front-end Develpment was done using 
            JavaScript and React Native. I was solely responsible for the Front-end development of multple screens within the app. 
            &emsp;The final product was well recieved by both our client and professors. We were also given an award for best design.
